## Functional Testing Types

- **Writing Test:** Verify the pencil writes smoothly on various paper types.
- **Erasing Test:** Ensure the eraser removes pencil marks cleanly and completely.
- **Sharpening Test:** Check that the pencil can be sharpened easily without breaking the lead.
- **Grip Test:** Confirm the pencil is comfortable to hold and use for writing and erasing.
- **Eraser Attachment:** Ensure the eraser is securely attached and does not detach during normal use.
- **Labeling:** Check if any markings (brand, hardness) are readable and durable.
- **Compatibility Testing:** 
  - Test writing and erasing on different paper types.
  - Ensure compatibility with standard pencil sharpeners.

## Non-Functional Testing Types

- **Usability Testing:** Observe comfort, ease of use, and accessibility for different users.
- **Performance Testing:** 
  - Measure writing longevity before sharpening is needed.
  - Test eraser durability and lead breakage frequency.
- **Load Testing:** Simulate extended writing sessions and multiple users.
- **Stress Testing:** 
  - Apply excessive force, drop the pencil, and expose it to extreme temperatures.
- **Security Testing:** 
  - Check for choking hazards, toxicity, and allergens.
- **Compliance Testing:** Verify adherence to safety and quality standards (e.g., ASTM, EN71).
- **Localization/Internationalization Testing:** 
  - Check labeling for different languages and cultural preferences.
- **Documentation Testing:** Verify clarity and accuracy of usage or safety instructions.
